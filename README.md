This is ideal for "Vacation Rental by Owner" (VRBO) or other short term let / rental portal sites. 
Any user with the authority to edit a listing will be able to maintain the calendar, whether it's a site admin, a listing owner, etc.

How to Install IProperty SAS
----------------------------
Clone or download the SAS repository. Then navigate into the respective plugin directoreies (plg_ip_sasadmin and plg_ip_saslisting) and zip ALL of the files and directories in the plugin directory into a single archive, one for each plugin. You should have TWO archives, one for plg_ip_sasadmin and one for plg_ip_saslisting.

Use the Joomla Extension Manager in your Joomla Admin to install the plg_ip_sasadmin and plg_ip_saslisting plugins. 
Enable the plugins in the Joomla Plugin Manager, and configure them as described in each plugin's README doc.

That's it! You've now got a simple and effective availability system for IProperty.
