How to Use IProperty (SAS) SASADMIN plugin
------------------------------------------

1. Install and enable PLG_IP_SAS_ADMIN.zip using the Joomla Extensions Manager / Plugin Manager.
2. Configure the options in the plugin parameters. These include: 

- Tab Title: The name of the Tab as shown in the Property Edit view. Defaults to Availability.
- Default Availability: Listings must default to either "Free / Available" or "Booked".
- Sale Types: the sale types you want to use the SAS system with. Defaults to "For Rent".
- Months: the number of months to show in the calendar view.
- Columns: the number of calendar columns to show. Use with the Months setting to fit your layout.
- Calendar Style: the CSS style for the calendar.
- Start Day: start the calendar week on Monday or Sunday.
- Date Style: show US or International date format.
- Free: the hexadecimal color to use with Free dates.
- Tentative: the hexadecimal color to use with Tentative dates.
- Booked: the hexadecimal color to use with Booked dates.

3. As Super Agent, Listing owner / agent or site Admin, edit the listing page (front or back end Property Edit view) and will see a new tab for "Availability".
4. Click on the dates in the Availability Calendar to change a date's status. Click multiple times to cycle through statuses.
5. Dates for a given listing will show to non-admin users by means of the PLG_IP_SASLISTING plugin, which also must be enabled.
