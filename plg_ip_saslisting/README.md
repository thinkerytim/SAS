How to Use IProperty (SAS) SASLISTING plugin
------------------------------------------

The SASLISTING plugin will show the availability calendar as a new tab in a valid listing. The listing must have a valid sale type as set in the SASADMIN plugin.
The tab title will use the PLG_IP_SASLISTING_TABTITLE value by default. Change this via a Joomla language override or in the language file.

1) Install and enable PLG_IP_SAS_ADMIN.zip using the Joomla Extensions Manager / Plugin Manager.
2) Configure the options in the plugin parameters. These include: 

- Position: Show the Availability tab Before or After the other tabs.

The plugin simply shows the dates available-- it does not allow users to select dates or search availability. As the name suggests, this is a "SIMPLE" availability system!
